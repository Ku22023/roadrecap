                1. **Study the New Zealand Road Code thoroughly:** This is the most important step in getting your learner licence. The Road Code contains all the official rules you must follow when driving in New Zealand. You need to understand different types of road signs (regulatory, warning, and information signs), road markings, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, railway crossings, and motorway rules. You must also learn give way rules at intersections and roundabouts, correct indicating, speed limits in different areas (urban, rural, and school zones), and safe following distances like the 2-second rule. The Road Code also explains alcohol limits, the dangers of distractions such as mobile phones, fatigue, and how to drive safely in bad weather. To prepare properly, study regularly, take notes, review difficult sections, and complete multiple online practice tests to improve your confidence and accuracy.

2. **Book your learner licence test through Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency:** Once you feel ready, you can book your theory test either online or by visiting a driver licensing agent such as AA or VTNZ. Make sure you choose a date and time when you are alert and not rushed. The booking fee usually covers both the theory test and the learner licence application. Double-check your personal details when booking to avoid mistakes. It is a good idea to book in advance, especially during busy times like school holidays, so you can secure a test slot that works for you.

3. **Prepare what to bring on test day:** Being organised will help you feel calm and confident. You must bring approved identification, such as a passport or birth certificate, and proof of address if required. If you wear glasses or contact lenses to meet the legal eyesight standard, you must bring and wear them. Arrive at least 15 minutes early to complete any paperwork and settle in before the test begins. Make sure you are well-rested and have eaten beforehand so you can concentrate fully during the test.

                4. **Sit and pass the theory and eyesight tests:** The learner licence test is completed on a computer and includes multiple-choice questions based on real driving situations. Many questions focus on safety, hazard awareness, and making correct decisions in traffic. Read every question carefully and think about what the safest option would be. You must reach the required pass mark to succeed. As part of the process, you will also complete an eyesight screening to ensure your vision meets the legal driving standard. Good eyesight is essential for recognising hazards and reading road signs clearly.

                5. **After you pass your learner licence test:** Once you pass, you will officially receive your learner licence and can begin driving legally under learner conditions. You must display L plates clearly on the front and back of the vehicle whenever you are driving. You must always have a supervisor seated in the front passenger seat who has held a full New Zealand driver licence for at least two years. You are not allowed to drive alone. This stage is designed to help you gain practical driving experience in different environments such as busy city streets, highways, and rural roads. The more safe practice you complete while following the rules, the more confident and prepared you will be when it is time to move on to your restricted licence.
